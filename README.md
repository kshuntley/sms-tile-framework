# SMS Tile CSS Framework

This CSS (Cascading Stylesheet) framework allows the user to create "tiles" and other artefacts on Moodle that are consistent with the design set by the SMS R2 training team. This look is achieved by applying CSS classes to elements.

While you can write the HTML by hand, we recommend using the Tile Builder to create the HTML and CSS to build your tiles. The Tile Builder (tilebuilder.v2.html) does not display well in Microsoft Edge (to be debugged), so it's recommended you download the entire folder to your desktop. 

The file custom.css contains CSS from the Marcus Clark theme.

The file sms-style.css (and sms-style.min.css) should be added to the target Moodle. It is generated from the LESS files in the less folder. Changes to variables (such as colours, etc) should be made to the respective LESS file.

## Did I just put my work online for thw whole world to see?

Ugh.

Forgive me, I need to tidy up the files. I'm pretty happy with the less but the html/js is just ugly right now. Forgive me, I haven't had much time to polish it all.
